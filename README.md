open-task-manager-state-machine is a modular embedded firmware framework that combines:

A task manager for cooperative multitasking,

A state machine engine for event-driven logic,

A robust Bootloader + Application architecture for secure firmware upgrade and isolation.

It is designed for resource-constrained MCUs (such as STM32, HK32, or similar ARM Cortex-M cores) and serves as a foundation for scalable embedded projects â€” from IoT devices to AI-driven smart controllers.
