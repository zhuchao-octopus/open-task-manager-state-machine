 * @brief   This file provides the definitions and function declarations for
 *          managing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) functionalities in the Octopus
 *          task manager.
 *
 * @details This file includes functions for handling BLE pairing, enabling and
 *          disabling BLE pairing modes, and tracking device status during
 *          communication. The macros define the state and event flags for BLE
 *          operations, making it easier to control and monitor BLE-related tasks.
